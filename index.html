    <h1>Stock Market & Mutual Funds</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Stock Market</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where the buying, selling, and issuance of shares of publicly-held companies take place.</p>
        
        <h3>Participants:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Investors:</b> Individuals or entities who buy and sell stocks with the aim of making a profit.</li>
            <li><b>Companies:</b> Entities that issue stocks to raise capital for various purposes, such as expansion, research and development, or debt repayment.</li>
            <li><b>Brokers:</b> Intermediaries who facilitate the buying and selling of stocks on behalf of investors.</li>
            <li><b>Regulators:</b> Government agencies or organizations responsible for overseeing and regulating the stock market to ensure fair and orderly trading.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Functioning:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Primary Market:</b> This is where newly issued securities are bought and sold for the first time, often through initial public offerings (IPOs).</li>
            <li><b>Secondary Market:</b> Here, previously issued securities are traded among investors, and prices are determined by supply and demand.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Stocks:</b> Represent ownership in a company and entitle the holder to a portion of the company's assets and earnings.</li>
            <li><b>Stock Index:</b> A measurement of the value of a section of the stock market. Common indices include the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite.</li>
            <li><b>Market Capitalization:</b> The total value of a company's outstanding shares of stock, calculated by multiplying the stock price by the total number of shares outstanding.</li>
            <li><b>Volatility:</b> The degree of variation of a trading price series over time. Higher volatility often implies greater risk.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Investment Strategies:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Long-Term Investing:</b> Buying and holding stocks for an extended period, typically years or decades, with the expectation of capital appreciation and dividends.</li>
            <li><b>Day Trading:</b> Buying and selling stocks within the same trading day to capitalize on short-term price movements.</li>
            <li><b>Value Investing:</b> Identifying undervalued stocks based on fundamental analysis with the expectation that their prices will eventually increase.</li>
            <li><b>Technical Analysis:</b> Analyzing historical price and volume data to forecast future price movements.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Mutual Funds</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Mutual funds are investment vehicles that pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities, managed by professional fund managers.</p>
        
        <h3>Structure:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Fund Manager:</b> Responsible for making investment decisions and managing the fund's portfolio in line with its investment objectives.</li>
            <li><b>Investment Advisory Committee:</b> Provides guidance and oversight to the fund manager.</li>
            <li><b>Custodian:</b> Safeguards the fund's assets and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.</li>
            <li><b>Shareholders:</b> Individuals or entities who invest in the mutual fund and own shares representing their proportional ownership of the fund's assets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Types of Mutual Funds:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Equity Funds:</b> Invest primarily in stocks, aiming for capital appreciation.</li>
            <li><b>Bond Funds:</b> Invest in fixed-income securities such as government and corporate bonds, aiming for regular income.</li>
            <li><b>Balanced Funds:</b> Hold a mix of stocks and bonds to balance risk and return.</li>
            <li><b>Index Funds:</b> Aim to replicate the performance of a specific stock market index.</li>
            <li><b>Sector Funds:</b> Focus on specific sectors such as technology, healthcare, or energy.</li>
            <li><b>Money Market Funds:</b> Invest in short-term, low-risk securities such as Treasury bills and commercial paper, offering stability and liquidity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Benefits:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Diversification:</b> Mutual funds spread investments across multiple securities, reducing individual stock risk.</li>
            <li><b>Professional Management:</b> Fund managers conduct research and make investment decisions, potentially outperforming individual investors.</li>
            <li><b>Liquidity:</b> Mutual fund shares can typically be bought or sold at the end of each trading day, providing liquidity to investors.</li>
            <li><b>Accessibility:</b> Investors can start with relatively small amounts and benefit from the expertise of professional managers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Considerations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Fees and Expenses:</b> Mutual funds charge fees for management and operating expenses, which can impact returns.</li>
            <li><b>Risk:</b> While diversification reduces risk, all investments involve some level of risk, including the potential loss of principal.</li>
            <li><b>Performance:</b> Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investors should assess a fund's investment strategy and track record.</li>
            <li><b>Tax Implications:</b> Mutual fund distributions may be subject to taxes, depending on the fund's holdings and investor's tax situation.</li>
        </ul>
